# Lillian Elek Analytics Portfolio

👋 Welcome! I'm Lillian Elek — 🚀 Data Analyst | Data Engineer | Emerging Data Scientist

With a Master's in Business Intelligence & Data Analytics and 4+ years of hands-on experience, I'm making the strategic move from analytics and engineering into data science. My background gives me something many data scientists lack: the ability to build production-ready systems that scale.

I've spent years mastering SQL, Python, Power BI, and Azure—building automated pipelines, optimizing databases, and creating dashboards that drive real business decisions. Now, I'm applying that engineering rigor to machine learning, statistical modeling, and predictive analytics.

What sets me apart is my end-to-end perspective. I don't just build models—I understand the entire data lifecycle. I know how to extract and transform messy real-world data, engineer meaningful features, validate model assumptions, and deploy solutions that stakeholders actually use. My work spans regression analysis, hypothesis testing, time series forecasting, and algorithm development.

I'm drawn to problems where data reveals hidden patterns and strategic insights—whether that's predicting operational outcomes, uncovering anomalies, or testing hypotheses that drive decision-making. My experience in clean-energy and SaaS environments has taught me to balance technical sophistication with practical business impact.
