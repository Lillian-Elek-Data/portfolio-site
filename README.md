# Elek Analytics Portfolio

👋 Welcome! I’m Lillian Elek — 🚀 Data Analyst | Data Engineer | Aspiring Data Scientist

I turn complex data into clear insights using **SQL, Python, Power BI, and Azure**. Whether it's building automated pipelines, developing machine learning models, or designing sleek dashboards that actually speak to stakeholders—I'm here to turn complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive smart decisions.

Recently, I’ve been diving deep into data science and machine learning, expanding my expertise to include algorithm design, model development, and hypothesis testing. I love exploring how patterns and anomalies in data can reveal meaningful, strategic answers to big questions.

With a deep toolkit spanning SQL, Python, Azure Data Factory, and Power BI (to name a few), I specialize in transforming raw data into strategic gold. My work supports everything from optimizing operations to testing hypotheses and uncovering predictive insights in large datasets.
